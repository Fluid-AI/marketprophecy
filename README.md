This notebook builds a few different styles of models including Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks (CNNs and RNNs). This is covered in two main parts, with subsections: 

* Forecast for a single time step:
  * A single feature.
  * All features.
* Forecast multiple steps:
  * Single-shot: Make the predictions all at once.
  * Autoregressive: Make one prediction at a time and feed the output back to the model.

## Fluid AI Test solution

I have applied several Machine Learning algorithms on all three datasets (BTC, NASDAQ and NSE). But Linear Regression performed the best so I choose it to predict the Close stock prices of test set. I got a train accuracy above 99.95 % and a test accuracy above 95.4 %. Also I have added separate Excel files depicting Actual and Predicted Close prices for all the three stocks.

First, I split the training data set in two to train the model with 80% of the data, and then I utilised the remaining 20% of the test dataset to predict the model, 
achieving a 100% out of sample accuracy.

After that, I loaded the testing data set to predict the model's accuracy and output, and I got a 97 percent accuracy while using R-square metrics to analyse the model.

step-1:
To train the model i have used nse training data 

step-2:
where i found there are missing values in data  and i droped nan values

step-3:
where i have used mean imputation to fill the missing values(not done but possible)

step-4:
where i have used standardization to normalize the data


step-5:
i have used lstm layer to predict the data i got loss as 0.02 because it is regression type problem and
to get accuracy i can use r2 score but i have used rmse to get how i got result rmse-0.02

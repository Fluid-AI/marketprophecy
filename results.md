# Predict the Market - Fluid AI Test

## Results

Tranined LSTM and ARIMA model and compared performance.

Chose Mean Squared Error(MSE) and Root Mean Square Error(RMSE) as evaluation metrics.

Performance Results:

|   | MSE	|RMSE|
| ----- | ------ | ------ |
|LSTM	|0.0092 | 0.0961|  
|ARIMA	|0.0031	| 0.0556|  

As the results shows ARIMA model performs better for this use case.
